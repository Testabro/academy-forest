Rules of thumb used from https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/contribute/get-started/write_a_good_pr

- Fix one problem. Don't try to tackle multiple issues at once.
- Limit the scope.
- Use commits. When PR felt a little big, changes were split into logical groups using git commits.

## Prerequisite:
   Python 3.10 - needed because of the use of match-case statements
 
## Run:
  python3.10 academy-forest.py
